Variables:
Sass allows you to use variables to store values that can be reused throughout your stylesheets. This makes it easy to make global changes to your website's design. To declare a variable in Sass, use the $ symbol followed by the variable name and the value.

I used a file called variables.scss for all colors and fonts


Custom Properties
Sass also supports CSS custom properties, which can be used to store values that can be reused throughout your stylesheets. Custom properties are defined using the -- prefix followed by the property name and value.

I used it in styles.scss file

Nesting
One of the key features of Sass is nesting, which allows you to nest selectors inside other selectors. This can make your CSS more readable and easier to understand.

I have used nesting in for sections and flex

Interpolation
Sass also supports interpolation, which allows you to include the value of a variable or expression inside a string. This can be useful for generating dynamic CSS

I have used this for table cell

Placeholder Selectors
Sass also provides placeholder selectors, which are selectors that can be reused throughout your stylesheets without generating any additional CSS. Placeholder selectors are defined using the % symbol.

I have used this for font size

Mixins
Sass also provides mixins, which are groups of CSS declarations that can be reused throughout your stylesheets. Mixins are defined using the @mixin directive.

I have used it for media queries
